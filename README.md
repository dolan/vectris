 # Vectris
 ### a tetrislike game that allows you to move in any direction

 Clear the stacks, earn the score. Win the game!

Use the arrow keys to move, spacebar to rotate. There's an in-game helpfile with instructions.

The prompt I used to generate the skeleton of this game is in [prompt.md](prompt.md)

## Demo
There's an Online demo at [Github Pages](https://dolan.github.io/vectris/index.html)
